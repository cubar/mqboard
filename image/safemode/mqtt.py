    # on_mqtt registers a callback coro to be launched when a connection to the MQTT broker
    # is established or torn down. It's useful to blink LEDs or to gate activity based on
    # the connection status.
    # The callbacks are made using create_task and are passed a `is_connected` True/False
    # argument.
    # Tip: given `async def my_cb(connected)` use `on_mqtt(my_cb)`.

    # on_init registers a callback awaitable to be awaited when the first connection to the broker
    # is made.
    # It is useful to trigger subscriptions and to generally delay starting activity until
    # there's a connection, which keeps more memory free to buffer boot logs until the connection
    # is made.
    # The callbacks are made using await and are processed in the order they are registered,
    # which is the order of the board.modules list. This allows modules, such as logging, to
    # push messages out in their callback while stalling the init process so memory usage is
    # kept under control.
    # Tip: given `async def my_cb(some, args)` use `on_init(my_cb(current, values))`.
